# ID-Asg1-Public

This project is a website aimed to provide the latest news about the idol group Aqours and their activities to the worldwide audience (because they're Japanese)
Website will be managed by an imaginary team called Team Amogus
## Design Process
The design for my website is absolutely horrible, it, mainly has 3 colours, grey, white and light blue. To make up for the horrible deisgn I mainly focus on the functionality part of the website.

#### -index.html
The index page starts off with a navigation bar (with a background that appears when you scroll down, very subtle), followed by a blurred hero image of the idol group with the team name on it.
The first container is static and has some information about the team with the logo and button which links to team.html, hovering over the logo also changes it into a funny gif.
The second container will change every 30seconds~ to another concert in the list under random.js, it changes with a sliding animation made using jquery's animate + javascript scrollleft + html inline block features. The slide contains an image, concert title and a short description along with a button that leads to concerts.html.
Mobile view will not have the concert image.
#### -members.html
The members page is meant to allow users visiting the site to learn more about the members of the idol group(Aqours), there are 9 members in Aqours and they're split into 3 subunits, which inspired the layout of this page. The user can sort by subunit which will change the content of the 3 slides to the members of the respective subunit. The slides can be changed using the arrows or the radio buttons, the slides features the member cards, name, birthday, age and a short bio. It also contains links to their instagram, twitter and website(actual ones). The background colour of the slides are based on the member's actual image colour.
